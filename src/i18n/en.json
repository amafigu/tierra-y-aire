      "descriptionFirst": "In the city of Rosario - Argetina, one of the largest cradles of musicians on the continent, Carlos Rodrigo “Rolo” Verón was recognized as a “distinguished artist” in the city of Rosario - Arget for his vast career and his permanent contribution to culture local and national. With an outstanding talent in percussion, he joined groups that led him to compose and collaborate in a large number of genres, ranging from tropical rhythms, folklore and rock and roll. With his art he not only toured the country, but his talent took him to the United States, Latin America and Europe.",
      "descriptionSecond": "In 2016 he founded the “Tierra y Aire percussion” project, a musical learning space that teaches children, young people and adults, including people with disabilities, to play various instruments from different regions such as: congas, djembe, dun dun, left-handed, keys, bells, among others. In our city he was part of different events, such as TedX, Rosario under the stars, Carnival at the Humberto de Nito Amphitheater, Inauguration of the Patio Market, among other great events. It should be noted that in 2020/21 he composed his first solo album, which he titled 'Fluir', being recorded and mastered at Penny Lane studios in the city of Rosario. The project, presented by Fernanda Gigliani, Popular Initiative, was unanimously approved by the rest of the councilors of the legislative body. The President of the Municipal Council, María Eugenia Schmuck, addressed the venue: “It is a pleasure that the venue is filled with art, we are very proud of this distinction since we have a city that is a breeding ground for great musicians, artists and educators. Not just anyone, no matter how good they are in their discipline, can teach, only those who can transform knowledge into empathy can do so, generating a construction space where everyone grows, which is why the feat that we are distinguishing today is admirable and exemplary."

      "mikeTiseyra": "Tierra y Aire is for me a space of Learning, Enjoyment, Containment and Friendship, where each of us, (adults and children), with the help of our teacher and director Rolo Verón, makes us express, in classes, essays , and public presentations, the knowledge acquired, from a challenging and enjoyable side. In the 8 years that I have been a member of Tierra y Aire I can say that IT IS A FEELING",

It makes me stay firm to learn and move forward so....Thank you for your contribution and support...Without you it would be much more difficult capo.Bancanos always with that dedication and crazy for what you do...It is transmitted and you don't know how!!!

He has infinite passion and patience, the classes are very agile and I never leave without learning something new, we work seriously but in a very fun way. I never thought it would be possible to play an instrument from day one!",
      "mumi": "Tierra y aire began as an adventure, an activity to awaken adrenaline, because I never dabbled in music... A range of sensations opened up in me that exceeded my expectations: coordination, attention, enjoyment,... A group of coordination , friendship and companionship. The support, patience and love provided by director Rolo is incomparable... Looking at life from another perspective that is healthy for the soul.",
      "marito": "Tierra y aire is my space for concentration, relaxation and musical concentration. The most beautiful thing is the groups, the good energy of the people and teacher Rolo. I can share this space in shows with my family. That is priceless, for them to see you up on stage and to see them from there, you are very excited.",

I don't know what brought me here, I just know that the power of the sounds reaches my soul and I enjoy it so much...... Thank you Rolo for teaching us with patience and passion. Thank you Tierra y Aire for giving us this space for shared enjoyment.",
      "silvinaPesaresi": "I tell you that we started this challenge so that Juan Jose could feel the music in a different way and we met a team of professionals and humans who make each class different and you leave with a full smile, then I join in and then Luzmi They carry an innate rhythm from their grandfather Pocho, the music heals and Rolo makes you live it to the fullest.",
      "flavia": "Tierra y Aire is a space where creation, laughter and learning (among other things) incredibly come together.
